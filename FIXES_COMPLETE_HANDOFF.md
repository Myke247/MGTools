## üìã What Was Fixed

### Issue 2: Multi-Harvest Slot Value Sync ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Slot index didn't update after harvesting multi-harvest crops.

**Root Cause:** Detection logic was looking for non-existent properties (`harvestsRemaining`, `maxHarvests`) on slotData.

**Solution:** Eliminated need for multi-harvest detection entirely!
- **New Approach:** Call `syncSlotIndexFromGame()` after EVERY harvest
- **Why It Works:**
  - For single-harvest crops: game doesn't advance slot, sync returns null (no-op)
  - For multi-harvest crops: game advances slot, sync updates MGTools to match
  - Game-agnostic, future-proof, no property name guessing needed

**Code Location:** `MGTools.user.js:20299-20338`

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Removed complex detection logic
// Added universal post-harvest sync
qmt(() => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const newIndex = window.syncSlotIndexFromGame();
    // Logs only if slot actually changed (isMultiHarvest = newIndex !== null)
  }, 100);
});
```

**Testing:** Harvest any crop. Multi-harvest crops should auto-advance, single-harvest crops should stay put.

### Issue 5: Ability Logs Display ‚úÖ

**Problem:** No diagnostic logs appeared despite diagnostic code existing.

**Root Cause:** Diagnostic logging used `debugLog('ABILITY_LOGS', ...)` which checks `ABILITY_LOGS` flag (set to `false`), not `FIX_VALIDATION` flag.

**Solution:** Added explicit `FIX_VALIDATION`-gated logging to `updateAbilityLogDisplay()`.

**Code Location:** `MGTools.user.js:18391-18400`

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
if (CONFIG.DEBUG.FLAGS.FIX_VALIDATION) {
  console.log('[FIX_ABILITY_LOGS] Update called:', {
    totalLogs: logs.length,
    filteredLogs: filteredLogs.length,
    filterMode: UnifiedState.data.filterMode,
    elementFound: !!abilityLogs,
    contextType: context === document ? 'document' : 'overlay'
  });
}
```

**Testing:**
1. Enable FIX_VALIDATION (see testing section below)
2. Trigger pet abilities
3. Check console for `[FIX_ABILITY_LOGS]` logs
4. Verify logs appear in UI

---

### Issue 7b: Hotkey Chat Blocking ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Hotkeys triggered when typing in game chat.

**Investigation:** `shouldBlockHotkey()` function exists and is called correctly, but no diagnostic logs appeared in testing.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive logging at hotkey handler level to show when/why blocking occurs.

**Code Location:** `MGTools.user.js:19675-19688`

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
if (shouldBlockHotkey(e)) {
  if (CONFIG.DEBUG.FLAGS.FIX_VALIDATION) {
    console.log('[FIX_HOTKEYS] Hotkey blocked - typing detected:', {
      key: e.key,
      tag: active?.tagName,
      id: active?.id,
      classes: active?.className,
      contentEditable: active?.contentEditable
    });
  }
  return;
}
```

**Benefit:** When user reports hotkeys still triggering in chat, logs will show exactly what element is focused and why detection failed.

**Testing:**
1. Enable FIX_VALIDATION
2. Open game chat
3. Type a character that's a hotkey (e.g., 'O')
4. Check console for `[FIX_HOTKEYS]` logs
5. Character should type normally without triggering hotkey

---

### Issue 8: Custom Room Player Count ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Adding custom room showed "0/6" instead of actual player count.

**Root Cause:** Immediate fetch code existed but didn't STORE the fetched data. `updateRoomStatusDisplay()` relies on data being in `UnifiedState.data.roomStatus.counts`.

**Solution:** Extract and store player count before calling display update.

**Code Location:** `MGTools.user.js:3854-3905`

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Extract player count and store it in UnifiedState
if (data && typeof data.numPlayers === 'number') {
  if (!UnifiedState.data.roomStatus) {
    UnifiedState.data.roomStatus = { counts: {}, lastUpdate: {} };
  }
  UnifiedState.data.roomStatus.counts[roomCode] = Math.max(0, Math.min(6, data.numPlayers));
  UnifiedState.data.roomStatus.lastUpdate[roomCode] = Date.now();
}
```

**Also Added:** Proper FIX_VALIDATION logging throughout fetch process.

**Testing:**
1. Enable FIX_VALIDATION
2. Add a custom room code
3. Player count should appear within 1-2 seconds
4. Console should show `[FIX_ROOMS]` logs with fetch details

---

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Enable Debug Mode (Optional but Recommended)

To see diagnostic logs for all fixes:

**Edit `MGTools.user.js` lines 609 and 620:**
```javascript
// Line 609
PRODUCTION: false,  // Change from true to false

// Line 620
FIX_VALIDATION: true  // Change from false to true
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Remember to reset these to `true` and `false` respectively before deployment!

### Step 2: Test Each Fix

#### Test Issue 2: Multi-Harvest Slot Sync
- [ ] Plant a multi-harvest crop (certain berries give multiple harvests)
- [ ] Harvest it
- [ ] **Expected:** Slot index advances to next crop automatically
- [ ] **Console (if FIX_VALIDATION enabled):** `[FIX_HARVEST] Post-harvest slot sync: { slotAdvanced: true, isMultiHarvest: true }`

#### Test Issue 5: Ability Logs
- [ ] Open MGTools abilities tab
- [ ] Wait for or trigger pet abilities
- [ ] **Expected:** Logs appear in the abilities panel
- [ ] **Console (if FIX_VALIDATION enabled):** `[FIX_ABILITY_LOGS] Update called: { totalLogs: X, filteredLogs: Y }`

#### Test Issue 7b: Hotkey Chat Blocking
- [ ] Open in-game chat popup/input
- [ ] Try typing a character that's a hotkey (e.g., 'O' for preset)
- [ ] **Expected:** Character types normally, hotkey doesn't trigger
- [ ] **Console (if FIX_VALIDATION enabled):** `[FIX_HOTKEYS] Hotkey blocked - typing detected: { key: "o", ... }`
- [ ] **If hotkeys still trigger:** Share the console output - it will show what element is focused and help diagnose

#### Test Issue 8: Custom Room Player Count
- [ ] Go to Rooms tab
- [ ] Add a new custom room code
- [ ] **Expected:** Player count appears within 1-2 seconds (not "0/6")
- [ ] **Console (if FIX_VALIDATION enabled):** `[FIX_ROOMS] Immediately fetching...` and `[FIX_ROOMS] Stored player count...`

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If a fix doesn't seem to work:

1. **Enable FIX_VALIDATION** (see Step 1 above)
2. **Perform the action** (harvest, add room, etc.)
3. **Check browser console** for `[FIX_*]` logs
4. **Share the console output** - the diagnostic logs will reveal why it failed

### Common Issues:

**"I don't see any [FIX_*] logs"**
- Verify `PRODUCTION: false` and `FIX_VALIDATION: true` at lines 609 and 620
- Hard-refresh the page (Ctrl+F5) to reload the script

**"Multi-harvest still doesn't work"**
- Check console for `[FIX_HARVEST]` logs
- Look for `slotAdvanced: true` in the logs
- If `slotAdvanced: false`, the crop might not be multi-harvest

**"Hotkeys still trigger in chat"**
- Console logs will show which element is focused when you type
- Share that info - it will help identify the correct chat selector

**"Custom room still shows 0/6"**
- Check `[FIX_ROOMS]` logs for API errors
- Verify the room code is valid
- Wait 5-10 seconds for the regular polling to update it

## üéì What We Learned

### Issue 2 Insight:
**Don't try to detect multi-harvest crops.** Just sync after every harvest. The game tells us if the slot changed!

### Issue 5 Insight:
**debugLog() != console.log()** - debug functions have their own flag systems. Use explicit console.log with FIX_VALIDATION for diagnostic work.

### Issue 7b Insight:
**Log at the decision point.** Logging deep inside shouldBlockHotkey() wasn't helpful. Logging at the handler where it's used shows the actual context.

### Issue 8 Insight:
**Fetching data isn't enough - you must store it.** The display functions rely on state being in specific locations.
