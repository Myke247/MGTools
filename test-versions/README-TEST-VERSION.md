## üîß Technical Details

### Changes Made (Line References)

1. **Lines 7915-7983**: `ensureUIHealthy()` function
   - Health check system with retry logic
   - Exponential backoff: 1s ‚Üí 2s ‚Üí 4s ‚Üí 5s ‚Üí 5s
   - Emergency fallback with visible error

2. **Lines 7985-8039**: `setupToolbarToggle()` function
   - Alt+M keyboard listener
   - Persistent state via localStorage
   - Toggle both dock and sidebar

3. **Lines 27537-27539** & **28877-28879**: Function calls
   - Called after `createUnifiedUI()` in both code paths
   - Ensures all UI elements are monitored

4. **Lines 2-6**: Metadata updates
   - Version: 3.8.9-TEST
   - Name: "MGTools TEST - UI Reliability Fix"
   - Description updated

### Why This Should Fix The Issue

**Original Problem:**
- Script runs at `@run-at document-end`
- Sometimes DOM isn't fully ready
- `createUnifiedUI()` runs but elements don't attach properly
- Chrome/Tampermonkey timing variations

**Our Fix:**
- Health check runs 500ms after UI creation
- If UI missing ‚Üí wait 1s ‚Üí try again
- If still missing ‚Üí wait 2s ‚Üí try again
- Continue with exponential backoff
- Max 5 retries over ~13 seconds total
- Should catch 99% of timing issues

## üöÄ Next Steps

### If Test Succeeds
1. Merge fixes into main branch
2. Release as 3.8.9 or 3.9.0
3. Update production script

### If Test Reveals Issues
1. Analyze console logs
2. Adjust retry timing/logic
3. Create TEST v2 if needed
