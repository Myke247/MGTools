## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEXT SONNET

### **DO NOT:**
- ‚ùå Push to GitHub
- ‚ùå Create commits
- ‚ùå Make pull requests
- ‚ùå Run any git operations except read-only commands

### **DO:**
- ‚úÖ Continue debugging the 3 failing issues
- ‚úÖ Read weird.txt for test results
- ‚úÖ Make edits to MGTools.user.js only
- ‚úÖ Test and iterate locally

---

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ **Working Fixes (Confirmed):**
1. **Issue 1:** Duplicate notifications button removed - WORKING
2. **Issue 3:** Discord environment compatibility enhanced - logs showing
3. **Issue 7:** Hotkeys focus gating improved - partially working (see Issue 7b below)

### üîß **Actively Debugging (3 Issues):**

#### **Issue 2: Multi-Harvest Slot Value Sync** - NOT WORKING
- **Problem:** `isMultiHarvest` is always `false`
- **Root Cause:** `slotData.harvestsRemaining` and `slotData.maxHarvests` are `undefined`
- **Current State:**
  - Logs show: `harvestsRemaining: undefined, maxHarvests: undefined`
  - Sync function exists: ‚úÖ `syncFunctionExists: true`
  - Detection logic is checking wrong property names
- **Next Step:**
  - Enhanced logging added at line 20300-20301:
    ```javascript
    console.log('[FIX_HARVEST] FULL slotData object:', JSON.stringify(slotData, null, 2));
    console.log('[FIX_HARVEST] slotData keys:', Object.keys(slotData || {}));
    ```
  - **ACTION REQUIRED:** User needs to harvest a multi-harvest crop and share console output
  - Once we see the actual property names, update lines 20304-20305 to use correct properties

#### **Issue 8: Custom Room Player Count** - NOT WORKING
- **Problem:** Shows `0/6` after adding custom room
- **Current State:**
  - Immediate fetch logic added (lines 3853-3877)
  - Logs should show `[FIX_ROOMS] Added to polling:` and `[FIX_ROOMS] Immediately fetching room info:`
- **Next Step:**
  - Check weird.txt for `[FIX_ROOMS]` logs
  - Verify if API call is succeeding
  - Check if room data is being returned correctly

#### **Issue 7b: Hotkeys Still Block In-Game Chat** - PARTIALLY WORKING
- **Problem:** Hotkeys still trigger when typing in the in-game chat popup
- **Current State:**
  - Enhanced `shouldBlockHotkey()` with chat pattern detection (lines 19468-19514)
  - Looks for classes/IDs containing: `['chat', 'message', 'input', 'text', 'field', 'edit']`
  - Logs when blocking: `[FIX_HOTKEYS] Blocking hotkey - detected chat input:`
- **Issue:** Detection is too broad OR game's chat doesn't match patterns
- **Next Step:**
  - Check weird.txt for `[FIX_HOTKEYS]` logs when typing in game chat
  - If no logs appear, chat element isn't being detected
  - Need to inspect game's chat DOM structure to find correct selectors

#### **Issue 5: Ability Logs "Completely Broken"** - INVESTIGATING
- **Problem:** No ability logs showing, user can't see logs
- **Current State:**
  - Added diagnostic logging at line 18580-18589:
    ```javascript
    console.log('[FIX_ABILITY_LOGS] Update called:', { force, currentLogCount, lastLogCount, willUpdate, petAbilityLogsExists });
    ```
  - Code appears intact (no modifications made to ability log system)
- **Next Step:**
  - Check weird.txt for `[FIX_ABILITY_LOGS]` logs
  - Verify if `petAbilityLogs` array is being populated
  - May be a pre-existing issue or UI display problem

## üîç Key Diagnostic Changes Made

### 1. **PRODUCTION Mode Disabled** (Line 610)
```javascript
PRODUCTION: false, // CHANGED FOR TESTING - was true, suppressing all logs
```
**Why:** Was blocking ALL console.log() output. Only errors/warnings showed.

### 2. **FIX_VALIDATION Enabled** (Line 619)
```javascript
FIX_VALIDATION: true // Enable to see fix debug logs
```
**Why:** Enables all `[FIX_*]` debug logs

### 3. **Alert Popup Removed** (Line 167)
- Removed `alert('MGTools is loading!')` - was annoying during testing

### 4. **Enhanced Multi-Harvest Logging** (Lines 20300-20314)
- Logs full slotData JSON structure
- Logs all property keys
- Shows why detection is failing

### 5. **Immediate Custom Room Fetch** (Lines 3853-3877)
- Fetches room info immediately on add (don't wait for 5s poll)
- Extensive logging of API call and response

### 6. **Enhanced Hotkey Chat Detection** (Lines 19468-19514)
- Pattern matching for chat elements
- Parent traversal (up to 5 levels)
- Logs when blocking hotkeys due to chat detection

## üìÇ Files Modified

### **MGTools.user.js**
- Line 610: `PRODUCTION: false`
- Line 619: `FIX_VALIDATION: true`
- Line 167: Removed alert popup
- Lines 20300-20314: Enhanced multi-harvest logging
- Lines 3853-3877: Immediate custom room fetch
- Lines 19468-19514: Enhanced hotkey chat detection
- Lines 18580-18589: Ability logs diagnostic logging

### **Syntax Status:** ‚úÖ Valid (verified with `node -c`)

---

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

### **Step 1: Analyze weird.txt**
Look for these log patterns:
```
[FIX_HARVEST] FULL slotData object: {...}
[FIX_HARVEST] slotData keys: [...]
[FIX_ROOMS] Added to polling: ...
[FIX_ROOMS] Immediately fetching room info: ...
[FIX_HOTKEYS] Blocking hotkey - detected chat input: ...
[FIX_ABILITY_LOGS] Update called: ...
```

### **Step 2: Fix Multi-Harvest Detection**
Once user provides harvest logs showing actual slotData structure:
1. Identify correct property names for multi-harvest detection
2. Update lines 20304-20305:
   ```javascript
   const isMultiHarvest = slotData?.ACTUAL_PROPERTY_NAME > 1 ||
                         slotData?.OTHER_PROPERTY_NAME > 1;
   ```

### **Step 3: Debug Custom Rooms**
Based on `[FIX_ROOMS]` logs:
- If API call fails ‚Üí check URL/auth
- If API succeeds but data wrong ‚Üí check response parsing
- If data correct but UI wrong ‚Üí check `updateRoomStatusDisplay()`

### **Step 4: Fix Hotkey Chat Blocking**
Based on `[FIX_HOTKEYS]` logs:
- If logs show when typing in chat ‚Üí detection working, need to fix preventDefault logic
- If no logs ‚Üí need to find correct selectors for game's chat element
- May need to inspect DOM: `document.activeElement` when chat is focused

---

## üêõ Known Issues

### **Hotkey Error in Logs:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
at formatHotkey (line 8747)
```
- Not from our changes
- Pre-existing issue
- Low priority (doesn't affect fix testing)

## üìù Testing Checklist

When user tests, ask for console output showing:

- [ ] Multi-harvest crop harvest ‚Üí `[FIX_HARVEST]` logs with slotData structure
- [ ] Custom room add ‚Üí `[FIX_ROOMS]` logs with API response
- [ ] Type in game chat ‚Üí `[FIX_HOTKEYS]` logs (or lack thereof)
- [ ] Pet ability trigger ‚Üí `[FIX_ABILITY_LOGS]` logs

## üìö Reference Files

- **Implementation Plan:** `MGTools_Fix_Implementation_Plan.txt`
- **Issue 2 Details:** `Issue2_FunctionTrace.md`
- **Test Results:** `weird.txt` (updated by user with console output)
- **Main File:** `MGTools.user.js` (31,337+ lines)

## üéì Context for Debugging

### **Why Multi-Harvest Fails:**
The game's crop data structure doesn't use `harvestsRemaining` or `maxHarvests`. We need to:
1. See actual property names in slotData
2. Update detection logic to use correct names
3. Test with actual multi-harvest crop (e.g., crops that give multiple harvests like berries)

### **Why Custom Rooms Show 0/6:**
Either:
1. API call is failing silently
2. Room data isn't being cached/stored
3. Display update timing issue
4. Room code format mismatch

### **Why Hotkeys Block Chat:**
Either:
1. Chat element not matching our patterns
2. Detection working but not blocking (preventDefault issue)
3. Game's chat is in shadow DOM or iframe we're not checking

---

## üí° Tips for Next Sonnet

1. **Read weird.txt first** - contains all test results and console output
2. **Search for `[FIX_` patterns** - shows which fixes are logging
3. **JSON.stringify() is your friend** - use to inspect complex objects
4. **Don't assume property names** - verify with actual game data
5. **Test one fix at a time** - easier to isolate issues
6. **Ask user for specific console output** - don't guess at data structures

---

## üöÄ Success Criteria

### **Multi-Harvest:**
- [ ] `isMultiHarvest: true` when harvesting multi-harvest crop
- [ ] `syncSlotIndexFromGame()` called successfully
- [ ] Slot value updates to next crop automatically
- [ ] Console shows: `[FIX_HARVEST] Multi-harvest sync result: { changed: true }`

### **Custom Rooms:**
- [ ] Player count shows within 1-2 seconds of adding room
- [ ] Console shows: `[FIX_ROOMS] Got immediate room data: { ... }`
- [ ] Room displays correct player count (not 0/6)

### **Hotkeys + Chat:**
- [ ] Can type in game chat without triggering hotkeys
- [ ] Console shows: `[FIX_HOTKEYS] Blocking hotkey - detected chat input` when typing
- [ ] Hotkeys still work outside of chat

### **Ability Logs:**
- [ ] Logs appear when abilities trigger
- [ ] Console shows: `[FIX_ABILITY_LOGS] Update called: { willUpdate: true }`
- [ ] Logs display in UI

**Last Updated:** Just before auto-compact threshold
**Next Action:** Wait for user's weird.txt console output after testing
