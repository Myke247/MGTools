You are operating on my local repo at:
C:\Users\MLvP3\ClaudeProjectRepo

Goal: Make lots of small commits for the modularization work on stacked branches that branch off each other, starting from origin/Live-Beta.
This is a DRY RUN. Do not run any command that writes to disk or pushes to GitHub. Only print what you would run and what would be staged/committed.

Rules (must follow exactly)

DRY RUN ONLY — No writes. Use --dry-run where possible and otherwise just echo commands.

Whitelist-only staging — Only include files directly related to modularization progress (listed below). Nothing else (no screenshots, logs, backups, scratch, tmp).

No “Co-authored-by” lines or trailers in commit messages. Do not add any author trailers at all.

Stacked branch structure — For each module, create a new feature branch off the previous feature branch (first one from origin/Live-Beta).

Never force-push in this dry run. Use git push --dry-run only.

If you see local diffs to files outside the whitelist, show them separately under “UNRELATED CHANGES (excluded by whitelist)” and do not stage them.

Branch naming (stacked PR style)

Base: origin/Live-Beta

m1: feat/modularization/m1-storage

m2: feat/modularization/m2-constants (branches from m1-storage)

m3: feat/modularization/m3-logging (branches from m2-constants)

m4: feat/modularization/m4-compat (branches from m3-logging)
(If any already exist locally/remotely, show how you’d sync/rebase in DRY RUN only.)

Whitelist (commit-only set)

.gitignore

MODULARIZATION_PROGRESS.md

build.js

src/index.js

src/core/storage.js (Module 1)

src/utils/constants.js (Module 2)

src/core/logging.js (Module 3)

src/core/compat.js (Module 4)

(Optional, only if diffs are strictly modularization-scaffold & headers) MGTools.user.js or mgtools.user.js

If this file includes unrelated bugfixes or feature changes, exclude it and list it under “UNRELATED CHANGES”.

Always exclude (examples/patterns)

node_modules/, dist/, *.log, *.tmp, *.backup, consolelogs*.txt

*.png, *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.gif, *.webp

mgdebug*, debug*, *.bak, *.old

What I want you to print (no execution)

Repo state summary

Current directory and confirmation it exists

git remote -v (DRY RUN: just show what you’d run)

git fetch --all --prune (show command only)

git branch -vv & git status --porcelain=v1 (show commands only)

The detected default branch and the presence of origin/Live-Beta

.gitignore check (DRY)

Show the exact .gitignore contents you’d ensure exist (append if missing):

node_modules/
dist/
*.log
*.tmp
*.backup
consolelogs*.txt
*.png
*.jpg
*.jpeg
*.gif
*.webp
mgdebug*
debug*


Do not write it. Just display the diff you’d create if changes are needed.

File inventory & whitelist diff

List which whitelist files exist vs missing.

For each whitelist file that exists, show git diff --name-only and a short --stat (commands and the output you’d expect) to confirm scope.

Separately list any non-whitelisted modified/untracked files as “UNRELATED CHANGES (excluded)”.

Stacked-branches plan (DRY)
For each module (m1..m4), print the exact commands you’d run, but do not run them. For example:

m1 (storage)

git switch -c feat/modularization/m1-storage origin/Live-Beta
git add -n .gitignore MODULARIZATION_PROGRESS.md build.js src/index.js src/core/storage.js
git commit --dry-run -m "Phase 2: Module 1 — storage layer; no behavior changes"
git push --dry-run -u origin feat/modularization/m1-storage


m2 (constants) (branch from m1)

git switch -c feat/modularization/m2-constants feat/modularization/m1-storage
git add -n .gitignore MODULARIZATION_PROGRESS.md build.js src/index.js src/utils/constants.js
git commit --dry-run -m "Phase 2: Module 2 — constants/config; no behavior changes"
git push --dry-run -u origin feat/modularization/m2-constants


m3 (logging) (branch from m2)

git switch -c feat/modularization/m3-logging feat/modularization/m2-constants
git add -n .gitignore MODULARIZATION_PROGRESS.md build.js src/index.js src/core/logging.js
git commit --dry-run -m "Phase 2: Module 3 — logging; unified logger; no behavior changes"
git push --dry-run -u origin feat/modularization/m3-logging


m4 (compat) (branch from m3)

git switch -c feat/modularization/m4-compat feat/modularization/m3-logging
git add -n .gitignore MODULARIZATION_PROGRESS.md build.js src/index.js src/core/compat.js
git commit --dry-run -m "Phase 2: Module 4 — compatibility layer (CSP/Discord/context); no behavior changes"
git push --dry-run -u origin feat/modularization/m4-compat


If (and only if) MGTools.user.js/mgtools.user.js contains pure modularization scaffolding (e.g., updated headers or imports relevant to modules), show an alternate commit line including it; otherwise list it under “UNRELATED CHANGES” and exclude.

Commit messages (print only)

Show the exact commit messages (one line + short bullets) you would use for each module.

Do not include any author trailers like “Co-authored-by”.

Safety checks

Confirm there are no commands that write, commit, or push in this dry run.

If the working tree has unrelated changes, show how you’d either:

keep them local (unstaged), or

stash them (print git stash push -m "<msg>" you would run, but do not run it), or

add extra .gitignore patterns (print diff only).

Final summary

A collapsed list of the exact commands you’d run for each module when I say “EXECUTE”.

Note again: no “Co-authored-by” lines will be added.

Return the full DRY RUN plan exactly as above. Do not run anything yet.
