DEVELOP BRANCH MODULAR IMPLEMENTATION - Current Status
========================================================
Date: 2025-10-26
Branch: develop
Status: Phase 4 IN PROGRESS - Build Complete, Ready for Browser Testing

COMPLETED PHASES:
✅ Phase 1: Reset develop to v2.0.0
✅ Phase 2: Merged all 55 modules to develop
✅ Phase 3: Created simplified bootstrap (src/init/modular-bootstrap.js)
✅ Phase 4.1: Fixed UNIFIED_STYLES export/import (CRITICAL FIX)

CURRENT STATE:
- develop has modular architecture with working UI styling
- Fixed: src/ui/overlay.js now exports UNIFIED_STYLES
- Fixed: src/init/modular-bootstrap.js imports and uses UNIFIED_STYLES
- Build compiles (warning about UnifiedState.data is expected/harmless)
- MGTools.user.js regenerated with proper CSS (29,672 lines, 1.28 MB)

PHASE 4.1 FIXES (Commit: 76065e9):
- ❌ Before: UNIFIED_STYLES passed as empty string '' → UI had no styling
- ✅ After: UNIFIED_STYLES properly imported from overlay.js → UI fully styled

NEXT STEPS (Phase 4.2 - Browser Testing):
1. Load MGTools.user.js in Tampermonkey (develop branch)
2. Visit Magic Garden site
3. Check if UI dock appears with styling
4. Test basic interactions (click buttons, verify tooltips)
5. If UI appears: Proceed to Phase 4.3 (wire features incrementally)
6. If issues found: Debug and fix

KEY FILES:
- src/init/modular-bootstrap.js (new simplified init)
- src/index.js (updated to use modular bootstrap)
- MODULAR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.txt (full plan)

COMMITS:
- e14b5aa: Merged modular to develop
- [latest]: Created simplified bootstrap

BRANCH STATUS:
- main: v2.0.0 working (stable)
- Live-Beta: v2.0.0 working (stable)
- develop: v2.1 WIP (testing simplified bootstrap)
- feat/modular-v2-wip: Preserved (all modular work safe)

NOTE: NO changes to main/Live-Beta yet - all work on develop for safe testing
