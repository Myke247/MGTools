========================================================
Date: 2025-10-26
Branch: develop
Status: Phase 3 COMPLETE - Ready for Phase 4 (Build & Test)

COMPLETED PHASES:
✅ Phase 1: Reset develop to v2.0.0
✅ Phase 2: Merged all 55 modules to develop
✅ Phase 3: Created simplified bootstrap (src/init/modular-bootstrap.js)

CURRENT STATE:
- develop has modular architecture
- New file: src/init/modular-bootstrap.js (simplified initialization)
- Updated: src/index.js (uses new bootstrap instead of Legacy Bootstrap)
- Build compiles (warning about UnifiedState.data is expected/harmless)

NEXT STEPS (Phase 4):
1. Build: npm run build:production
2. Test in browser (develop branch MGTools.user.js)
3. Check if UI appears
4. If UI appears: Wire features incrementally
5. If UI doesn't appear: Debug createUnifiedUI dependencies

KEY FILES:
- src/init/modular-bootstrap.js (new simplified init)
- src/index.js (updated to use modular bootstrap)
- MODULAR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.txt (full plan)
