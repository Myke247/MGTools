# Changelog - MGTools

## Version 1.1.1 (2025-10-22)

**Critical Bug Fix:**
- Fixed pet swapping to work with FULL inventory (100/100 items)
- Replaced broken StorePet/PlacePet approach with native SwapPet messages
- Pet preset swapping now works atomically without requiring free inventory slots

**Implementation Details:**
- 5 handler locations updated to use native game swap mechanism
- For each slot: SwapPet exchanges active pet ↔ inventory pet directly
- Empty slots still use PlacePet, excess pets use StorePet
- 100ms delays between operations for connection reliability

**UI Improvements:**
- Version checker now clearly shows "Your Branch (Beta/Stable)" vs "Other Branch"
- Removed excessive debug console logs for cleaner console output
- Beta version displays with orange/yellow colors, Stable with green colors

**Why This Matters:**
- Previous fix (v1.1.0) added delays but still failed with full inventory
- Native SwapPet bypasses inventory space requirement completely
- Users can now swap pets regardless of inventory fullness

## Version 1.1.0 (2025-10-21)

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed game update popup to auto-click CONTINUE button before reloading
- Previously popup was detected but not dismissed, causing state issues
- Now properly clicks CONTINUE → waits 500ms → shows countdown → reloads

**Performance Improvements:**
- Inventory counter optimized: 500ms → 1000ms update interval
- Reference counting prevents duplicate intervals when multiple shop UIs open
- Increased safe interval timings: ability monitoring (3s→5s), notifications (10s→15s), update checks (5s→10s)
- Cached room polling selectors (5-second cache)
- Added cleanup for shop tab switching and popout closing

**Expected Performance Impact:**
- FPS gain: +20-40%
- DOM queries: -75% reduction
- No duplicate intervals
