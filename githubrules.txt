Stable = release branch (what players should install).

Beta = integration branch where finished features land and get tested together.

Feature branches (feat1, feat2, …) = short-lived branches cut from Beta for each chunk of work.

“Complete work” circle = when a feature is finished:

merge featN → Beta,

then immediately merge Beta → every other open feature so each dev rebases/merges and resolves conflicts early.

When Beta is good, open PR Beta → Stable (tag a release). Then repeat for the next set of features.

So the rule is: all features branch off Beta, merge back to Beta when done, and regularly pull Beta into themselves so they never drift.

Never mention you are co-author

Keep changelog/readme simple for user friendliness, no need to add how we fixed something. You can however, add the simple feature changes and bug fixes, update the version in all locations for what we are working on so it makes sense.

Keep a changelog in discord syntax in the caludeprojectrepo on my local pc with the changelog descending since in discord you always see the bottom part of a chat first.

In GitHub its better to use ascending for the changelog, if that makes sense. (like we are currently)
