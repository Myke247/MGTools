2. Replaced createUnifiedUI() function with hybrid dock implementation
3. Added new UI functions: openSidebarTab(), renderTabContent(), openPopoutWidget()
4. Preserved Alt+B hotkey for shop access
5. Implemented draggable dock with orientation toggle
6. Implemented collapsible tail group for secondary tabs

**What Was NOT Changed**:
- All business logic functions
- UnifiedState structure
- TimerManager and globalTimerManager
- All value calculation logic
- All Firebase integration
- All storage operations
- All notification systems
- All existing tab content generators and handlers

**Fixes Applied** (2025-10-04):

**Initial fixes**:
1. Fixed tab rendering - now properly calls existing `updateTabContent()` function
2. Fixed dock item clicks - sidebar now opens correctly
3. Fixed Alt+B hotkey - shop tab now opens as expected
4. Added dedicated drag handle (â‹®â‹® icon) - prevents accidental resize
5. Fixed drag behavior - dock now moves smoothly without resizing

**Second round fixes**:
1. **Alt+B now toggles shop windows** - Opens seed shop (left) and egg shop (right), press again to close
2. **Updated egg shop prices** to match new pricing:
   - Common Egg: 50k â†’ 100k
   - Uncommon Egg: 500k â†’ 1M
   - Rare Egg: 2.5M â†’ 10M
   - Legendary Egg: 10M â†’ 150M
   - Mythical Egg: 50M â†’ 5B
3. **Removed drag handle icon** - entire dock background is now draggable (except icons)
4. **Fixed tail group hover** - now closes when mouse leaves dock entirely (not just tail group)
5. **Fixed Shift+click popouts** - now properly renders tab content in floating widgets

**Third round fixes**:
1. **Shop icon click behavior** - Clicking shop icon now triggers Alt+B style slide-out windows (both seed and egg shops)
2. **Shop item name colors** - Added proper color coding classes for all seed/egg rarities including rainbow animation for celestial items
3. **Widget toggle** - Shift+clicking same icon again now closes the widget
4. **Widget drag smoothness** - Fixed typo (startY = e.clientY) and implemented requestAnimationFrame for smooth dragging
5. **UI consistency** - All UI elements (sidebar, popouts, shop windows) now use matching styles and animations

**Fourth round fixes**:
1. **Ability filters styling** - Improved filter button layout, added proper spacing/padding, better visual hierarchy
2. **Sidebar width** - Increased from 320px to 350px to prevent "None" button cutoff
3. **Widget drag delay** - Removed transition CSS causing delayed drag feel, now instant and smooth
4. **Popout widget width** - Increased min-width from 280px to 320px for better content display

**Fifth round fixes**:
1. **Shop dual sidebars** - Converted shop to use slide-out sidebars (left for seeds, right for eggs) instead of floating windows
2. **Shop sidebar styling** - Matching sidebar style with proper transitions and 350px width
3. **Egg restock detection** - Already working correctly in setupShopWindowHandlers (applies to both seeds and eggs)
4. **Widget cursor** - Changed from crosshair/move to grab/grabbing cursor for all widgets
5. **Dock drag re-enabled** - Added edge detection with grab cursor on edges (12px threshold) for intuitive dragging

**Sixth round fixes**:
1. **Dock icon tooltips** - Added hotkey information to tooltips (Shop shows "Shop â€¢ Alt+B")
2. **Help section updated** - Comprehensive documentation of all features including dock controls, shop interface, and keyboard shortcuts
3. **Turtle timers** - Already implemented and initialized (displays crop growth estimate with turtle pets active)
4. **Crop slot value** - Added value display below turtle timer showing total worth of current crops (gold color, formatted with commas)

**Seventh round fixes**:
1. **Pet loadout dropdown visibility** - Fixed white text issue by adding explicit option styling (background + color)
2. **Ability logs in widgets** - Fixed by including `.mgh-popout` selector in updateAllAbilityLogDisplays
3. **Turtle timer logic** - Now only shows when turtle pet is active (checks for active pets with turtle)
4. **Slot value always visible** - Slot value now displays always (not just with turtle), shows gold ðŸ’° with formatted value
5. **Version checker** - Added green/red dot indicator in dock:
   - Green: Up to date âœ“
   - Red: Update available (clickable, opens GitHub)
   - Orange: Check failed/timeout
   - Checks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Myke247/MGTools/main/magicgardenunified.hybrid.user.js

**Eighth round fixes**:
1. **Version checker fix** - Switched from GM_xmlhttpRequest to fetch API for better compatibility
2. **Slot value calculation** - Fixed by using SHOP_PRICES instead of undefined SEED_VALUES
3. **Tab hotkeys** - Added Ctrl+1-7 to open/close tabs (changed from Alt to avoid teleport conflict):
   - Ctrl+1 = Pets
   - Ctrl+2 = Abilities
   - Ctrl+3 = Seeds
   - Ctrl+4 = Values
   - Ctrl+5 = Timers
   - Ctrl+6 = Rooms
   - Ctrl+7 = Shop
4. **Widget hotkeys** - Added Shift+Ctrl+1-7 to open/close popout widgets
5. **Help section updated** - Added comprehensive documentation for:
   - All new keyboard shortcuts (customizable in Hotkeys tab)
   - Turtle timer & slot value info
   - Version indicator explanation
6. **Version indicator moved to tail** - Now only visible when hovering â‹¯ icon (less clutter)
7. **Version bumped to 2.0.0** - Hybrid UI migration complete

**Ninth round fixes (Final)**:
1. **Version checker URL fixed** - Changed from magicgardenunified.hybrid.user.js to MGTools.user.js (was 404)
2. **Turtle timer duplication fixed** - Now removes ALL existing estimates/values before inserting (querySelectorAll + forEach remove)
3. **Slot value calculation working** - Uses SHOP_PRICES correctly
4. **updateTabContent null check** - Added safety check to prevent setAttribute error on null element
5. **Ability logs in widgets fixed** - Pass popout context to setupAbilitiesTabHandlers and call updateAbilityLogDisplay
6. **Hotkeys changed to Ctrl** - All tab hotkeys use Ctrl instead of Alt (Alt+1-9 used for teleporting)

**Tenth round fixes (Version Checker)**:
1. **Multi-URL fallback system** - Tries 4 different URLs in order:
   - version.json (lightweight, preferred)
   - MGTools.user.js from main branch
   - MGTools.user.js from master branch
   - GitHub API endpoint
2. **Created version.json** - Simple JSON file: `{"version": "2.0.0"}` for fast updates
3. **Improved error handling** - Orange dot is clickable to open GitHub releases even on failure
4. **Help section updated** - Explains how version checker works

**Eleventh round fixes (Slot Value Calculation)**:
1. **Fixed slot value calculation** - Now uses same logic as Values tab:
   - Changed from `SHOP_PRICES` to `speciesValues` lookup table
   - Changed from `isHybrid ? 1.5 : 1` to `calculateMutationMultiplier(slot.mutations)`
   - Now properly accounts for all mutations (Rainbow, Gold, Weather, Time combos)
   - Uses `UnifiedState.atoms.friendBonus` instead of `targetWindow.myGarden.friendBonus`
2. **Slot value now accurate** - Shows correct value for both growing and mature crops
3. **Matches Values tab exactly** - Uses identical calculation formula: `Math.round(multiplier * speciesVal * scale * friendBonus)`

**Twelfth round fixes (Final Polish)**:
1. **Shop display names** - Added `SHOP_DISPLAY_NAMES` mapping for cleaner names:
   - `OrangeTulip` now displays as just "Tulip" in shop (internal name unchanged for compatibility)
   - Easy to add more overrides as needed
2. **Slot value for mature crops** - Fixed `insertTurtleEstimate()` to work for ALL crops:
   - Now searches for crop name element (CACTUS, STARWEAVER, HARVEST, etc.) as fallback
   - Slot value displays for both growing crops (with timer) and mature crops (no timer)
   - Turtle timer still only shows when timer element exists
3. **Version checker links fixed** - Changed from `/releases` (404) to direct script file:
   - Red dot: Opens `https://github.com/Myke247/MGTools/blob/main/MGTools.user.js`
   - Orange dot: Opens same link (was going to `/releases` which doesn't exist)
   - Users can now directly view/install the latest script
4. **Help section updated** - Fixed version indicator description

**Thirteenth round fixes (User Feedback)**:
1. **Version checker URL corrected** - Changed all URLs from `MGTools.user.js` to `magicgardenunified.user.js`:
   - Checks: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Myke247/MGTools/main/magicgardenunified.user.js`
   - Links: `https://github.com/Myke247/MGTools/blob/main/magicgardenunified.user.js`
   - Now matches actual filename on GitHub
2. **Sidebar scroll reset** - Fixed "Quick Load Preset" being cut off at top:
   - Added `sidebarBody.scrollTop = 0` when opening tabs
   - Ensures content always starts at the top when switching tabs
3. **Mature crop detection improved** - Better element detection for slot value:
   - Changed from hardcoded crop names to mutation keyword detection
   - Now looks for "Rainbow", "Gold", "Frozen", "Wet", "Chilled", "kg", etc.
   - Works with all crops regardless of name

**Fourteenth round fixes (Persistence)**:
1. **Dock position persistence** - Dock now remembers position and orientation:
   - Position saved to `localStorage.mgh_dock_position` on drag end
   - Orientation saved to `localStorage.mgh_dock_orientation` on toggle
   - Both restored automatically on page reload
   - Functions: `saveDockPosition()`, `loadDockPosition()`, `saveDockOrientation()`, `loadDockOrientation()`
2. **Pet loadout data** - Already has migration/fallback logic:
   - Data stored in `MGA_petPresets` (GM storage primary, localStorage fallback)
   - Migration code runs automatically on script init
   - If someone lost presets: check GM storage or restore from localStorage
   - Debug: Open console, run `console.log(GM_getValue('MGA_petPresets'))`

**Fifteenth round fixes (Version Checker Improvements)**:
1. **Cache-busting** - Added timestamp query parameter to force fresh fetches:
   - `?t={timestamp}` added to all raw.githubusercontent.com URLs
   - Bypasses GitHub's CDN cache (normally 2-5 minutes)
   - API endpoint doesn't need cache-busting (always fresh)
2. **Manual refresh** - Version indicator now clickable:
   - **Click dot**: Manually trigger version check (refreshes instantly)
   - **Shift+Click dot**: Open script on GitHub (when update available or failed)
   - Green dot tooltip: "Up to date! âœ“ (click to recheck)"
   - Red dot tooltip: "Update available - Click to recheck â€¢ Shift+Click for GitHub"
   - Orange dot tooltip: "Check failed - Click to retry â€¢ Shift+Click for GitHub"
3. **Initial tooltip** - Shows "(click to refresh)" hint on load

**Sixteenth round fixes (Widget Toggle & Sidebar Width)**:
1. **Widget hotkey toggle** - Pressing hotkey again now closes widget:
   - Updated `createInGameOverlay()` to detect existing overlays
   - If visible: removes overlay and clears from state
   - If hidden: shows overlay and brings to front
   - Works for all Alt+V, Alt+P, Alt+A, etc. hotkeys
2. **X button confirmation** - Close button already existed in widgets (top-right corner)
3. **Help section updated** - Added widget controls documentation:
   - Press hotkey again to toggle
   - Click X button to close
   - Drag header to reposition
   - All hotkeys customizable
4. **Sidebar width increased** - Changed from 350px to 380px:
   - Main sidebar: `width: 380px`, `left: -400px`
   - Shop sidebars: `width: 380px`, `left/right: -400px`
   - Fixes "Quick Load Preset" button being cut off
   - Better spacing for all content
5. **Documentation created**:
   - `INTRODUCTION.txt` - User-friendly intro for GitHub announcement
   - `FEATURES-AND-HOTKEYS.txt` - Comprehensive feature/hotkey reference

**To update version.json on GitHub:**

**IMPORTANT**: The version checker looks for `version.json` first (fastest). If it doesn't exist, it falls back to parsing the .user.js file.

**Option 1 (Recommended)**: Create `version.json` in your repo root:
```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "name": "MGTools - Hybrid Dock UI",
  "changelog": [
    "Complete UI migration to hybrid dock system",
    "Dual shop sidebars (left=seeds, right=eggs)",
    "Popout widgets with Shift+click",
    "Custom hotkeys (Ctrl+1-7 for tabs, Shift+Ctrl for widgets)",
    "Version checker with green/red indicator",
    "Turtle timer and slot value display",
    "Dock position persistence",
    "All features from v1.17.0 preserved"
  ]
}
```

**Option 2 (Fallback)**: If version.json doesn't exist, the checker will parse `magicgardenunified.user.js` to find `@version 2.0.0` in the header.

**Version Checker Behavior**:
- **Green dot**: Script up to date
- **Red dot**: Update available (click to open GitHub)
- **Orange dot**: Check failed (404 or network error, click to open GitHub)

Just update the version number when you release a new version!

**Next Steps**:
1. Reload the script in your userscript manager
2. Test all tabs (click dock icons)
3. Test Alt+B hotkey for shop
4. Test drag handle (â‹®â‹® icon) to move dock
5. Test orientation toggle (â†” icon)
6. Test Shift+click on icons for popouts

**Important**: This migration now properly integrates with the existing `updateTabContent()` function. All business logic has been preserved - only the UI shell was replaced.
