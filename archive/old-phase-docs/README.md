# Old Phase Documents Archive

This directory contains historical phase/analysis documents from the modularization journey.

## What's Here

These files documented the step-by-step extraction process across Phases A through F:
- Phase analysis documents
- Audit reports
- Session summaries
- Critical fix documentation
- Version-specific notes

## Why Archived?

These docs served their purpose during development but are now outdated. They've been moved here to:
- Reduce clutter in the main directory
- Preserve historical context
- Prevent confusion (they reference old architectures)

## Current Documentation

**For current project information, see:**
- `SESSION_STATUS.md` - Current state (Phase G COMPLETE)
- `ARCHITECTURAL_100_QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference
- `README.md` - User documentation

## Architectural 100% Achieved

As of January 2025, MGTools achieved Architectural 100%:
- src/ is the single source of truth
- MGTools.user.js is auto-generated
- 55 ES6 modules, 7 layers, full DI pattern
- 95.1% extraction (maximum realistic)

These archived docs show the journey to get here!
